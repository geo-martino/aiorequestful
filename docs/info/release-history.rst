1.0.20
======

Fixed
-----
* Fix bug in :py:class:`.RequestHandler` where the kwargs for non-cached sessions
  were not being removed from the request. This was causing some requests to fail on non-cached sessions.


1.0.19
======

Fixed
-----
* Improve request retry flow to log on all status codes if retry attempts fail.
  This was previously only logging if a status code handler was configured for that status code.


1.0.18
======

Fixed
-----
* Response text from failed request now logged as expected.


1.0.17
======

Changed
-------
* Improve message when raising a :py:class:`.ResponseError`. Now includes the response text and omits empty messages.


1.0.16
======

Fixed
-----
* Bug causing default response handlers to not be set on :py:class:`.RequestHandler` when not provided.
  Default response handlers are now set as expected in this case.


1.0.15
======

Fixed
-----
* Bug in various functions which caused a repeating requirement for the `method` and `url` kwargs.
  Now only requires the `method` and `url` kwargs once.


1.0.14
======

Fixed
-----
* Drop debug print statement in :py:class:`.RequestHandler`


1.0.13
======

Fixed
-----
* :py:class:`.RequestHandler` passes all kwargs to request method again. This was broken in 1.0.12.


1.0.12
======

Changed
-------
* :py:class:`.RequestHandler` raises the ``aiohttp`` error if given on failed requests
  instead of 'Max retries exceeded' error


1.0.11
======

Added
-----
* :py:class:`.BytesPayloadHandler` for return raw bytes of responses


1.0.10
======

Added
-----
* :py:meth:`.AuthRequest.set_payload_type` and ``payload`` property to :py:class:`.AuthRequest`.
  This allows for payload type switching for each requests.
  This is to solve an issue where some OAuth providers require the payload in either the body or query of the request
  depending on the providers specification.

Removed
-------
* ``_param_key`` class attribute in :py:class:`.OAuth2Authoriser` now allows for control over  for child classes
  Support for switching the payload handling of requests is now handled solely by :py:class:`.AuthRequest`.


1.0.9
=====

Changed
-------
* :py:class:`.OAuth2Authoriser` now allows for control over params key for child classes
  via the ``_param_key`` class attribute.
  This now supports delivering params via either the query or body or the request.


1.0.8
=====

Fixed
-----
* :py:class:`.AuthorisationCodeFlow` now correctly picks up the returned state value from the redirect URL
  even if it also contains the HTTP version


1.0.7
=====

Changed
-------
* Handle no response as a retry using the retry timer in :py:class:`.RequestHandler`


1.0.6
=====

Fixed
-----
* Drop debug print statement


1.0.5
=====

Fixed
-----

  to fix issues in Python v3.13


1.0.4
=====

Fixed
-----
* Removed debug print statement


1.0.3
=====

Fixed
-----
* Bug in :py:meth:`get_iterator` causing :py:class:`.RequestInfo` objects
  to iterate its properties instead of itself
