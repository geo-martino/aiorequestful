=========================
Welcome to aiorequestful!
=========================

An Asynchronous HTTP and RESTful API requests framework for asyncio and Python
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Full implementation of authorisation handling for authorising with any HTTP service, including OAuth2 flows
* Automatic response payload caching and cache retrieval on a per-endpoint basis to allow fine control over
  how and when response data is cached
* Customisable payload response handling to transform responses before returning and caching
* Automatic handling of common HTTP error status codes to ensure guaranteed successful requests
* Formulaic approach to retries and backoff handling to ensure smooth requests on sensitive services to handle
  'Too Many Requests' style errors
